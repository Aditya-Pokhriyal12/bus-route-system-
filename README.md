## Overview

The Bus Route Handling System provides a modern, user-friendly, and real-time bus tracking solution that allows users to track the location of buses on a map. This system enhances the public transportation experience by providing accurate bus locations and estimated arrival times. OpenStreetMap integration is used to display and interact with maps.

The project features separate portals for drivers and passengers, with comprehensive authentication systems, real-time tracking, ticket booking capabilities, and a futuristic dark theme with neon accents.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: Used for designing and styling the user interface.
- **React**: Developed the front-end interface and real-time map tracking.
- **Express**: Built the backend server for handling API requests and managing data.
- **MongoDB**: Used for storing and managing bus route data.
- **Socket.io**: Enabled real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **OpenStreetMap**: Integrated for displaying and interacting with maps (free alternative to Google Maps).
- **Vite**: Modern build tool for fast development and optimized production builds.
- **React Router**: Client-side routing for seamless navigation between pages.
